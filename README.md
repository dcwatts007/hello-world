# Development Environment

I used vs code to create this program. Vs code is a coding platform that allows you to program in a variety of languages by downloading extensions for your languages. I used the .NET, C#, and C# Dev Kit extensions to create my hello world program. 

I used C# as I prefer object oriented programming, and c# is a very convienient language for that. I have expierience using it and in my expierience it is great for abstraction and design.
